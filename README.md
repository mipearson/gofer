# Gofer!

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/mipearson/gofer.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/mipearson/gofer) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/gofer.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/gofer) [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/mipearson/gofer.png)](https://gemnasium.com/mipearson/gofer)


**Gofer** is a set of wrappers around the Net::SSH suite of tools to enable consistent access to remote systems.

**Gofer** has been written to support the needs of system automation scripts. As such, **gofer** will:

  * automatically raise an error if a command returns a non-zero exit status
  * print and capture STDOUT and STDERR automatically
  * allow you to access captured STDOUT and STDERR individually or as a combined string
  * override the above: return non-zero exit status instead of raising an error, suppress output
  * persist the SSH connection so that multiple commands don't incur connection penalties
  * allow multiple simultaneous command execution on a cluster of hosts via `Gofer::Cluster`

Full documentation for latest gem release is at [RDoc](http://rdoc.info/gems/gofer/frames)

## Examples

### Instantiation

``` ruby
h = Gofer::Host.new('my.host.com', 'ubuntu', :keys => ['~/.ssh/id_rsa'])
```

### Run a command

``` ruby
h.run "sudo stop mysqld"
```

### Copy some files

``` ruby
h.upload 'file', 'remote_file'
h.download 'remote_dir', 'dir'
```

### Interact with the filesystem

``` ruby
if h.exist?('remote_directory')
  h.run "rm -rf 'remote_directory'"
end

h.write("a string buffer", 'a_remote_file')
puts h.read('a_remote_file')
puts h.ls('a_remote_dir').join(", ")
```

### Respond to command errors

``` ruby
h.run "false" # this will raise an error
response = h.run "false", :capture_exit_status => true # this won't ...
puts response.exit_status # and will make the exit status available
```

### Capture output

``` ruby
response = h.run "echo hello; echo goodbye 1>&2\n"
puts response         # will print "hello\n"
puts response.stdout  # will also print "hello\n"
puts response.stderr  # will print "goodbye\n"
puts response.output  # will print "hello\ngoodbye\n"
```

### Send input

``` ruby
response = h.run "sed 's/foo/bar/' 1>&2\n", :stdin => "hello foo\n"  # will print "hello bar"
```

### Prefix output

``` ruby
h.output_prefix = 'apollo'        # or set :output_prefix on instantiation
h.run "echo hello; echo goodbye"  # prints apollo: hello\napollo: goodbye
```

### Suppress output

``` ruby
h.run "echo noisy", :quiet => true               # don't print stdout
h.run "echo noisier 1>&2", :quiet_stderr => true # don't print stderr
h.quiet = true                                   # never print stdout
```

### Run the same commands on multiple hosts

``` ruby
cluster = Gofer::Cluster.new
cluster << Gofer::Host.new('my.host.com', 'ubuntu', :keys => ['key.pem'], :output_prefix => "   my")
cluster << Gofer::Host.new('other.host.com', 'ubuntu', :keys => ['key.pem'], :output_prefix => "other")

# Run on all the hosts at once
cluster.run "hostname"

# Run on only one host at a time
cluster.max_concurrency = 1
cluster.run("sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart")

# Run a command on only one host
host = cluster.shuffle.first
host.run("rake migrations")

# Inspect the results from each host
results = cluster.run "echo hostname"
puts results.values.join(", ") # will print "my.host.com, other.host.com"

# Capture exceptions from each host
begin
  cluster.run "rake deploy"
rescue Gofer::ClusterError => e
  e.errors.each do |host, exception|
    $stderr.puts "Failed on #{host} with #{exception}, rolling back ..."
    host.run "rake rollback"
  end
  raise e
end
```

## Testing

  * Ensure that your user can ssh as itself to localhost using the key in `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.
  * Run `rspec spec` or `bundle install && rake spec`
  * rbenv users can run `test.sh` and ensure their code works on Ruby versions we support

## Contributing

Contributions should be via pull request. Please add tests and a note in the
`README.md` for new functionality. Please use 1.8.7-compatiable syntax.

## TODO

  * ls, exists?, directory? should use sftp if available rather than shell commands
  * Deal with timeouts/disconnects on persistent connections
  * Release 1.0 & use Semver
  * Add unit tests, bring in Travis.ci
  * Local system usage (eg `Gofer::Localhost.new.run "hostname"`)
