# Gofer!

**Gofer** is a set of wrappers around the Net::SSH suite of tools to enable consistent access to remote systems.

**Gofer** has been written to support the needs of system automation scripts. As such, **gofer** will:

  * automatically raise an error if a command returns a non-zero exit status
  * print and capture STDOUT and STDERR automatically
  * allow you to access captured STDOUT and STDERR individually or as a combined string
  * override the above: return non-zero exit status instead of raising an error, suppress output
  * persist the SSH connection so that multiple commands don't incur connection penalties

## Examples

### Instantiation

    h = Gofer::Host.new('my.host.com', 'ubuntu', :keys => ['key.pem'])

### Run a command

    h.run "sudo stop mysqld"

### Copy some files

    h.upload 'file', 'remote_file'
    h.download 'remote_dir', 'dir'

### Interact with the filesystem

    if h.exist?('remote_directory')
      h.run "rm -rf 'remote_directory'"
    end

    h.write("a string buffer", 'a_remote_file')
    puts h.read('a_remote_file')
    puts h.ls('a_remote_dir').join(", ")

### Respond to command errors

    h.run "false" # this will raise an error
    response = h.run "false", :capture_exit_status => true # this won't ...
    puts response.exit_status # and will make the exit status available

### Capture output

    response = h.run "echo hello; echo goodbye 1>&2\n"
    puts response         # will print "hello\n"
    puts response.stdout  # will also print "hello\n"
    puts response.stderr  # will print "goodbye\n"
    puts response.output  # will print "hello\ngoodbye\n"

### Suppress output

    h.run "echo noisy", :quiet => true               # don't print stdout
    h.run "echo noisier 1>&2", :quiet_stderr => true # don't print stderr
    h.quiet = true                                   # never print stdout

### Run multiple commands

    response = h.run_multiple(['echo hello', 'echo goodbye'], :quiet => true)
    puts response.stdout # will print "hello\ngoodbye\n"

## Planned Features

    # constant connection (no reconnect for each action)
    Gofer::Host.new(...).open do |h|
      h.run( ... )
    end

    # overriding defaults
    h.set :quiet => true
    h.set :capture_exit_status => false

    # Local system usage, too:
    Gofer::Localhost.new.run "hostname" # > my.macbook.com

## Testing

  * Ensure that your user can ssh as itself to localhost using the key in `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.
  * Run `rspec spec` or `bundle install && rake spec`

## TODO

* ls, exists?, directory? should use sftp if available rather than shell commands
* wrap STDOUT with host prefix for easy identification of system output
* Deal with timeouts/disconnects on persistent connections
